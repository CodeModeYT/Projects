# Python-tools
A bunch of useful Python tools, growing everyday.
## Info
I developed the tools for my own use and decided to share them. I am continiously working on them and commit to them almost everyday.
## Tools
- File creator `(finished)`
- File deleter `(finished)`
- File renamer `(work in progress - almost done)`
## Future
I will soon add folders to organize them, as well as an all-in-one file, with all tools combined. Also an exe with a simple UI is planned.
